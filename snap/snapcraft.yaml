summary: Helper utility used to expand shell variables defined in a file.
description: |
  With this script, you can expand the file with env variables defined before using
  its contents. Originally conceived to help in the Docker container images creation,
  when consumer scripts expected a plain string text (for the record, `debconf-set-selections`)
  but you wanted to preprocess the file before using it.
